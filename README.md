# E-Commerce_App
- Welcome to my "E-commerce Product List"! 

- My motivation for this project was to create a React Application that displays a simple webpage example of product information from a list of products that customers can choose from and add to their cart if they please.

- For this project I used, Vite + React, JSX, HTML and CSS. 

- This purpose of this app is to display products for a user to choose from while shopping on this site.  

- I learned how to use JavaScript's "state" and "props" to manage state and to pass product data between components to successfully render information to the UI. 

- The 3 main components of this application are: 

- App.jsx = Here I created an array of products object and stored it using the "useState" hook imported from the React Library. 

- ProductList.jsx = For this component I am using JavaScript's map() function to render the products in the array using the Card layout defined in the ProductItem component.

- ProductItem.jsx = This component is a basic layout card style to render each product's specific details - name, price, image and description.
